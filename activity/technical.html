					C LANGUAGE
				</header>
				<p>
					C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
				</p>
				<p>
					C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Easy to learn</li>
					<li>Structured language</li>
					<li>It produces efficient programs</li>
				</ul>
				<code>
					#include stdio.h<br>

					int main() {<br>
					   /* my first program in C */<br>
					   printf("Hello, World! \n");<br>
					   
					   return 0;<br>
					}

					C++ LANGUAGE
				</header>
				<p>
					C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. 
				</p>
				<p>
					C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich libray support and a variety of data-types.</li>
					<li>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.</li>
					<li>Mid-level language: It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</li>
				</ul>
				<code>
					int main()<br>
					{
					   // displays Hello World! on screen<br>
					   cout<<"Hello World!";<br>

					   return 0;<br>
					}

					PHP
				</header>	
				<p>
					PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

					PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

					PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.

					PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.

					PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.

					PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.

					PHP Syntax is C-Like.
					Five important characteristics make PHP's practical nature possible −
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Simplicity.</li>
					<li>Efficiency</li>
					<li>Security</li>
				</ul>
				<code>
					      php echo "Hello, World!";

					Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.
				</p>
				<p>Why to Learn java Programming?
				Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</li>
					<li>Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</li>
					<li>Simple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</li>
				</ul>
				<code>
					Live Demo
					public class MyFirstJavaProgram<br>
					{<br>
						public static void main(String []args)<br>
						 {<br>
							System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World<br>
						}<br>
					}<br>

					JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

					Why to Learn Javascript
					Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
				</p>
				<p>
					There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</li>
					<li>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</li>
					<li>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</li>
				</ul>
				<code>
					 document.write("Hello World!")<br>
				</code>

				<p>
					Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.

					Why to Learn Python?
					Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
				</p>
				<p>
					Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
					<li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
					<li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
				</ul>
				<code>
					print ("Hello, Python!");
