			India's biggest strength is space technology, thanks to the dreams of late President Abdul Kalam.<br>
			 He continued to inspire the younger generation though he was not physically alive.<br><br>

			With his inspiration, some youngsters have launched the Kalam Dream Home project to organise <br>
			live exhibitions in schools to motivate the young minds to think of big things. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) <br>
			is now in a position to launch satellites of the U.S. and Britain too from the launch pad at Sriharikota.<br>
			 India is currently helping 20 countries in launching satellites for various purposes.<br><br>

			The Mars Orbiter Mission Mangalyaan, launch of navigation satellite, GSLV and other satellites <br>
			 make Indians proud of themselves. It raises many questions among the young minds as they cannot <br>
			  understand their importance and technology though they knew that India had been in top position in space technology. <br><br>

			New Central School's effort <br>

			The New Central School in Srikakulam and the Kalam Dream Home organized a series of exhibitions to enlighten students.<br>
			 "India needed many scientists in future to make the country unbeatable in technology. We will explain the benefits of rockets, <br>
			  their manufacture, and procedure involved in launching of satellites in a simple manner. <br>
			   It naturally helps students to understand the subject easily," said P. Srikanth, Director of the School.<br><br>

			Project Manager K. Haribabu said they would explain the greatness of space scientists like Abdul Kalam, <br>
			 Vikaram Sarabhai, Satish Dhawan and others. Former District Educational Officer Balivada Malleswara Rao said <br>
			  the exhibitions would strengthen the dedication among the kids and make them top scientists. <br><br>

			"Inspiring stories of great people like Abdul Kalam will certainly change the mindset of the students at early age. <br>
			 Moreover, their presentation and demonstration will help them know the complicated space subject in an easy manner," he added.<br><br>
